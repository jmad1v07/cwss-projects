    text: "This project consists of multiple Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) across the Australian continent that are designed for advanced studies of biogeochemical processes and elemental/isotope cycles within near-surface reservoirs, including vegetation, soils, vadose zone and groundwater. Partnering with national research infrastructure projects TERN and AuScope, OzCZO fills crucial gaps in environmental monitoring, particularly regarding soil dynamics, root zones, and integrated processes within the critical zone."

    text: "This project will assess and map a regional scale cyanobacterial mat extent. In the Exmouth Gulf and Pilbara coast, salt flats occur on the landward edge of intertidal zone, often bordered seaward by fringing mangroves and landward by dunes. Salt flats cover 1026 square kilometres in the Exmouth Gulf, an area over six times greater than mangroves here. Globally, these environments are understudied, yet are of increasing interest due to the salt minerals they contain."

    text: "This project aims to develop knowledge and water planning tools for farmers who need their dams to work in all years and be able to make water investment decisions with confidence. The project involves 12 core demonstration sites, building farm-based water planning tools, workshops, field days and industry training. The project investigates solutions including renovating existing dams, building new dams, and implementing evaporation suppression and runoff technologies."

    text: "This research project focuses on the challenges faced by native fish populations in Australian ephemeral rivers where thermal extremes and hypoxia (lack of oxygen) have led to regular fish-kill events. There is a lack of clear understanding about why some species are more tolerant than others, and how decision-makers can anticipate fish-kill risks. The goal is to develop a next-generation fish habitat model that stakeholders can use to assess fish-kill risks and plan restorations."

This research investigates: 1) how the foliage colour and texture of arid-adapted plants influence public perceptions of coolness, and; 2) how air temperature and soil moisture are related to plant colour and texture. The research team will synthesise current knowledge and conduct pilot studies in Perth, Tucson, Arizona."

    text: "The project aimed to predict salinity levels and understand the significant changes the Coorong system, at the end of the Murray-Darling Basin, has undergone due to prolonged drought periods. This drought has led to a degradation of the seagrass community, and our research sought to identify the causes preventing its recovery. We developed models to predict salinity levels and understand the requirements of the Rupert communities. These models are being utilised by local governments to inform their decision-making processes and guide their efforts to restore the ecosystem."

An integrated ecosystem model is developed to predict changes in water quality and habitats under different future scenarios. In parallel, a productivity pathway is established by developing a water quality response model specifically for Cockburn Sound. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and inform effective management strategies."
